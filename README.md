Everything int he game is randomized including the rules of the game.

We were not using git so this isnt exactly the same as what we submitted and is a broken version I had laying around on my HD that I uploaded to github for nestalgic reasons.

Shoorting for some reason doesnt work after the first 2 bullets and the radmom rule broke. Unfortunatly we trialed teams on unity for the progject and I cant get the finisehd one back unless i pay for teams and get in contact with the orignalt hoster of the project.
